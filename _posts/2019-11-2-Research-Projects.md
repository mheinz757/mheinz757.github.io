Current research project: 
"New resummation techniques of divergent series: the Painlev√© equation PII." I have worked on this research project at The Ohio State University under Professor Ovidiu Costin from February 2018 to March 2019 and August 2019 to present. The research is on advanced methods for resummation of divergent series to convergent solutions that give maximum information about the behavior of the associated function when dealing with incomplete information. I presented research results at the 2018 Ohio State Autumn Undergraduate Research Festival, the 2019 Ohio State Denman Undergraduate Research Forum, and the 2019 Young Mathematicians Conference at Ohio State. 

Other research projects: 
"Smooth particle hydrodynamics for hydrodynamic fluctuations." I worked on this research project at Wayne State University under Professor Chun Shen from May 2019 to July 2019. The goal of the research project was to use the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to solve PDE's for hydrodynamic fluctuations in high energy nuclear conditions. I wrote an open source code package in C++ with C++ 11 standard as well as a report on my findings, which can be found here https://bitbucket.org/wayne_state_nuclear_theory/sph_solver/src/master/.

"Virtual links." I worked on this research project at The Ohio State University under Professor Sergei Chmutov from June 2017 to December 2017. In this research project, I worked with two other undergraduates to try to develop a novel knot invariant that would be able to distinguish more knots than current invariants on virtual knots. Together, we develop a program to output different knot invariants for any inputted virtual knot to assist us in testing out our potential knot invariants in comparison to the existing ones.
