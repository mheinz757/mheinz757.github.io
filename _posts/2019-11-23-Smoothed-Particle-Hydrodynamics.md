### Smoothed particle hydrodynamics for hydrodynamic fluctuations

I worked on this research project at Wayne State University under Professor Chun Shen from May 2019 to July 2019. During my 10 weeks at WSU, I wrote an [open source code package](https://bitbucket.org/wayne_state_nuclear_theory/sph_solver/src/master/) in C++ with C++ 11 standard that used a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm from astrophysics to solve the hydrodynamic evolution equations (a set of non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs)) for relativistic fluids created in high-energy collisions between atomic nuclei. This exposed me to advanced scientific computing as a method of applying mathematical ideas to real-world problems in physics. I also wrote a [report](/research/SPH_Report.pdf) on my findings.
