### Smooth particle hydrodynamics for hydrodynamic fluctuations

I worked on this research project at Wayne State University under Professor Chun Shen from May 2019 to July 2019. The goal of the research project was to use the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to solve partial differential equations for hydrodynamic fluctuations in high-energy nuclear conditions. I wrote an open source code package in C++ with C++ 11 standard as well as a report on my findings, which can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/wayne_state_nuclear_theory/sph_solver/src/master/).
