### Smooth particle hydrodynamics for hydrodynamic fluctuations

I worked on this research project at Wayne State University under Professor Chun Shen from May 2019 to July 2019. The goal of the research project was to use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to solve partial differential equations for hydrodynamic fluctuations in high-energy nuclear conditions. I wrote an open source code package in C++ with C++ 11 standard, which can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/wayne_state_nuclear_theory/sph_solver/src/master/), as well as a [report](/research/SPH_Report.pdf) on my findings.
