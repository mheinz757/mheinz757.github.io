title: "Research Project: Exploration in Low Energy Nuclear Theory"
---

I worked on this project at The Ohio State University under Professor Robert Perry from June 2016 to December 2016. I independently studied various problems in quantum mechanics and discussed my findings with Professor Perry. I also attended the meetings of the Low Energy Nuclear Theory group at Ohio State, allowing me to experience many different people's perspectives on various research projects and how a large research group functioned.
