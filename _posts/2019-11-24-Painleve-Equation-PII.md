title: Research Project: Resummation of Divergent Series 
---

"New resummation techniques of divergent series: the Painlev√© equation PII." I have worked on this research project at The Ohio State University under Professor Ovidiu Costin from February 2018 to March 2019 and August 2019 to present. The research is on advanced methods for resummation of divergent series to convergent solutions that give maximum information about the behavior of the associated function when dealing with incomplete information. I presented research results at the 2018 Ohio State Autumn Undergraduate Research Festival, the 2019 Ohio State Denman Undergraduate Research Forum, and the 2019 Young Mathematicians Conference at Ohio State.
