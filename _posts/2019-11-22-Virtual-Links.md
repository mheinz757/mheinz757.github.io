title: "Research Project: Virtual Links"
---


I worked on this research project at The Ohio State University under Professor Sergei Chmutov from June 2017 to December 2017. In this research project, I worked with two other undergraduates to try to develop a novel knot invariant that would be able to distinguish more knots than current invariants on virtual knots. Together, we develop a program to output different knot invariants for any inputted virtual knot to assist us in testing out our potential knot invariants in comparison to the existing ones. A description of the project and program can be found [here](https://people.math.osu.edu/chmutov.1/wor-gr-su17/wor-gr.htm).
