I am a first-year graduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. During my time as an undergraduate at The Ohio State University, I have on research in low-energy nuclear theory, virtual knot theory, hydrodynamics in high-energy nuclear theory, and resummation of divergent series of solutions to partial differential equations. My main hobbies include playing chess, boxing, skiing, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.
