I am a 4th-year undergraduate at The Ohio State University studying Mathematics and Physics. I am interested in applying to graduate school in both Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Over my time as an undergraduate, I have worked on research in virtual knot theory, hydrodynamics in high energy nuclear theory, and resummation of divergent series of solutions to partial differential equations. My main hobbies include playing chess, boxing, skiing, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.
