I am a first-year graduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. My research interests include computational fluid dynamics and numerical differential equations. During my time as an undergraduate at The Ohio State University, I did research in various areas, including low- and high-energy nuclear physics, virtual knot theory, and resummation of divergent series. My main hobbies include chess, League of Legends, Dungeon and Dragons, hiking, and skiing.
